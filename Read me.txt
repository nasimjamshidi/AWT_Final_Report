# AWT_Final_Report


It has to be noted that four different types of files have been uploaded:
• First, all three presentation slides.
• Second, the final report of the project in IEEE format.
• Third, three Jupyter notebook files can be found in repository. 

        One is for simple (blind) cross validation and dataset split which 
        we have done in the Second part of our work. The second is the model 
         build using one-leave-out cross validation which has a complete data 
         preprocessing of the data and done for third/final step of the project.
         The third is showing how RD curves and convex hull is build.

• Forth, four figures as mentioned in the final report.
